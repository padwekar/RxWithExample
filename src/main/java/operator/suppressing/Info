There are a number of operators that will suppress emissions that fail to meet a specified criterion.
These operators work by simply not calling the onNext() function downstream for a disqualified emission,
and therefore does not go down the chain to Observer. We have already seen the filter() operator,
which is probably the most common suppressing operator.
